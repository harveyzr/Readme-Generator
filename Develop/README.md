 ## Description
The main goal of this project is to make a readme generator with node and inquirer.

 Code quiz is the ninth challenge for the Ohio State coding bootcamp.
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding backend with node.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying for the 9 weeks.

-	I learned how to code and deploy a simle webpage with nothing more than node, and inquirer.
